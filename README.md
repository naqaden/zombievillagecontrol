Zombie Village Control
====================

This is a 1.12.2 Forge coremod.

* Change the percentage of villages that are zombie villages
* Invert the check, so that only e.g. 5% of villages *aren't* zombie villages.

Made for some guy on reddit.

## Licensing Bullshit

Can you imagine being stupid enough to release a mod (for any game, not only Minecraft) and not post the source code under a permissive or copyleft license? I can't.

Anyway it's MPL-2.0
